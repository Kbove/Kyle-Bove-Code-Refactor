### Description
We have successfully built out Horiseons website homepage and formatted the code to look clean and meet accessibility standards. The homepage includes a navigation bar at the top that potential customers can use to easily find more information on Horiseon's services via their website. The marketing dept also regularly publishes articles on the industry and the homepage provides three small blurbs plus links to those articles. WE built a sleek sidebar that displays the use-cases/benefits to customers using Horiseon's services. On the bottom of the page is Horiseons signature.
